Learning Objective:
Create a high-functioning team to design a mobile robot system that is capable of autonomous
and remote control and interacts with various objects.

Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this project, the student team should be able to
• Program a robot to use a gripper or other custom part to retrieve and deposit items.
• Program a robot to navigate autonomously in a cluttered environment using various
sensor feedback.
• Use wireless controllers to remotely manipulate the robot.
• Translate a high-level design into properly commented code with modular functions to
achieve all the objectives of the final project.
• Verify the system requirements

Competition Overview:
You need to save some stragglers from an invasion of alien monsters. The diagram below shows
the competition environment in which your robot must navigate and interact with objects. The
overall surface is 78”x72”, which is approximately the surface of a ping-pong table. The red and
green lines are walls that are 6.5” high. The dark black line is actually a white line that is painted
on a black surface and can be used to guide the robot. Your ultimate goal is to rescue the
straggling civilians from the monsters and escort them back to the pickup zone. Along the way,
you can gain extra points by picking up powerful weapons, knocking out alien monsters, using
first aid kits, and leaving behind structures to block the monsters.
